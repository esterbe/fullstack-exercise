Fullstack exercise - React app, using node.js and mongodb

This repository demonstrates a fullstack application, using react for frontend and Express and Mongodb for backend.


How to get started:
1. Clone the repository.
2. cd bigpanda-fullstack-exercise
3. run ./startup.sh to start server, db and client
4. By default the application uses port 8008 for server and port 3000 for frontend.
   In case the frontend port is occupied the user will be prompt with a question asking to confirm the use on another port instead.
   Type 'y' to confirm.
